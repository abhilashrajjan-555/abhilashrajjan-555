# Hi, I'm Abhilash Rajjan

**I'm not a developer.** I'm an operations leader with 8+ years in customer experience and AI-driven scaling. Every project on this profile was built using AI coding assistants — Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, and other AI tools.

Zero traditional coding background. Just domain expertise, clear thinking, and AI.

**This is what's possible when AI meets someone who knows the problem deeply.**

## How I Work

I don't write code line-by-line. I describe what I need, iterate with AI, and ship.

My workflow: **Domain problem → Clear spec → AI pair programming → Working product**

The tools I use:
- **Claude Code** & **ChatGPT** for building full-stack apps
- **Cursor** for AI-native code editing
- **Prompt engineering** to get precise outputs
- **Vercel / GitHub Pages** for deployment

## My Day Job

**AI Operations & CX Leader** — I've spent 8+ years scaling operations teams and integrating AI into real business workflows.

- Scaled a 10-person team to 50+, driving 30% YoY revenue growth
- Pioneered GenAI integration that cut operational costs by $450K+ annually
- Maintained 95% customer satisfaction (industry average: 78%)
- Built India-Australia 24/7 service delivery operations

## Why This Matters

The gap between "idea" and "working software" is collapsing. I'm proof that domain experts — not just developers — can now build real tools that solve real problems.

If you have deep expertise in any field, you can build software. The AI tools are ready. The question is: what problem do you know better than anyone else?
